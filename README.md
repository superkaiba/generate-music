# generate-music
Final project for MAIS 202: Accelerated Introduction to Machine Learning bootcamp, hosted by the McGill Artificial Intelligence Society.

Goal: Generate tonal piano music using machine learning. 

Change model architecture in utils.py -> create_model()

Use Data.py to generate new .npy files to train with

Use train.py to train model from .npy files (train data, possible labels, encoded labels)

Use params.py to change general parameters such as number of timesteps for model, or possible durations for notes
